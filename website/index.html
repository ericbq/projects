				<h2 class="header">What do I do and who am I?</h2>
				<p>I am currently in the fourth year of my degree program in Computer Science and Engineering and in the first year of my Master of Science in Human-Computer Interaction at the Royal Institute of Technology (KTH) in Stockholm. I really enjoy when the work I do directly affects and helps other people which is why as of late I have chosen to focus on user experience and front end development. My minor will be in Interaction Design. </p>

				<p>My three year Bachelor of Science have given me a good foundation in Computer Science and I am now looking to obtain deeper knowledge within HCI. I am very eager to learn and as I am in an early stage of my career I find any challenge that can provide experience in the field of HCI interesting!</p>

				<p>As a person I am social, empathetic and easy to work with. An earlier employer said that “Eric is a very sympathetic and likeable person who is also very positive. He is not afraid to take on new challenges. He is very cooperative, flexible, diligent and punctual.”</p>

				<p>I continuously look for challenges that will give me experience and help me grow as an individual. I have engaged in various projects and volunteer work at KTH. I have worked with the reception of new Computer Science students for the last two years. The first year as regular personnel but this year I was a member of the project management group as well. Being a part of such a big project, planning and realizing five weeks of activities for more than 200 people, was really challenging, fun and rewarding.</p> 

				<p>Currently I am the head of the Sports Committee on the Computer Science chapter which means that I arrange various sports events for CS students, varying from weekly activities such as football, floorball and volleyball to bigger events such as trying out ice hockey with full equipment. I am also a part of the project Studs where I am responsible for planning a two to three week long trip abroad for 28 people. Studs involves visits and events with various interesting companies to establish a connection to the business and industrial life.You can read more about Studs at <a href="http://studieresan.se/en"> the project website.</a></p>

			<h2 class="header">Programming</h2>
			<div class="text">
				During my Bachelor’s degree 90% of all the code I produced was written in Java. As of recent most of my coding tends to be front-end development and working with HTML, CSS and different JavaScript libraries. Since I started at KTH I have crossed paths with a vast amount of programming languages from various programming paradigms; Haskell, Prolog, C, Go, C++, SQL and php just to name a few. My time at KTH has taught me that I can take on any programming language or challenge thrown at me and come out on top. I am really looking forward to the challenges the future has in store for me.
